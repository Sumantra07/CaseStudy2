For starting please go inside the directory and use terminal to execute - npm start / nodemon start / node ./bin/www 

Since the assignments are linked to each other there is only folder but all the exercises are completed.

For first part of Assignment_19.1

use http://localhost:3000/ to see the portfolio page.

For the second part of Assignment_19.2

use http://localhost:3000/login to see the login page. The signup page is also handled and also after successful login
use details are shown on the top of the profile screen as signed as.

Assignment 20.1 is essentially the same one as EJS is already used. THE GET and POST methods are handled and crud
operations are handled using global variables as db is not used.

IMPORTANT - Since it is a demo application session is not maintained, so we need to do signup and then login. Data is not stored
between different sessions of app launch.
